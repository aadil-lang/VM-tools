This is an IMAGE-BASED question. Follow these specific instructions:

You are an expert educational content creator specializing in visual question generation. Your task is to create a NEW question with an image, graph, or table that is similar in style, format, and visual presentation to the base question provided.

## INPUT

You will receive:

1. A base question containing an image, graph, or table

2. The subject/topic area

3. Grade level (if applicable)

4. Any specific standards alignment (optional)

## YOUR TASK

Create a completely NEW question that:

### Visual Similarity Requirements

- Uses the SAME type of visual (if base has a bar graph, create a bar graph; if it has a diagram, create a similar diagram)

- Matches the visual style: colors, layout, labeling conventions, scale, and overall aesthetic

- Uses similar complexity level in the visual presentation

- Maintains comparable visual clarity and readability

- Includes similar elements (e.g., if base has gridlines, axis labels, legends - include these)

### Content Requirements

- Tests the SAME or similar mathematical/scientific concept or skill

- Maintains similar difficulty level

- Changes the specific numbers, data, objects, or scenario to create a fresh question

- Uses different context or real-world application when appropriate

- Ensures the question is pedagogically sound and has a clear, unambiguous answer

### Format Requirements

- Match the question structure (multiple choice, open-ended, fill-in-the-blank, etc.)

- Preserve any special formatting from the base question

- Include answer choices if the original has them (with similar format) - CRITICAL: The base question has {num_options} options, so ALL copy questions MUST have EXACTLY {num_options} options (same as base question)

- Provide the correct answer and explanation

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Provide:

1. **New Question Text**: The complete question stem

2. **Image/Graph/Table Description**: Detailed description of the visual to be created, including:

   - Type of visual

   - Specific data/values to display

   - Colors, labels, and styling details

   - Dimensions and scale

3. **Answer Choices** (if applicable) - MUST have EXACTLY {num_options} options

4. **Correct Answer**

5. **Solution Explanation**: Brief explanation of how to solve

## EXAMPLE WORKFLOW

If given a bar graph showing fruit sales with blue bars on a white grid:

- Create a bar graph with a DIFFERENT topic (e.g., temperature over days)

- Use similar blue bars on white grid

- Match the axis labeling style

- Create a new question about the same skill (e.g., reading values from a bar graph)

- Maintain similar difficulty

Now, analyze the base question provided and create your similar question following all the requirements above.

This is a WORD PROBLEM question. Follow these specific instructions:

Prompt for Generating Similar Word Problems from Base Question

Objective:
Generate similar word problems based on a provided "Base Question" while maintaining the same mathematical concept, difficulty level, and problem-solving approach.

Instructions:
Given the Base Word Problem shown above, create multiple similar word problems that:

1. Analyze the Base Question (DISPLAYED ABOVE)

The base question is shown at the beginning of this prompt. First, identify these key elements from THAT base question:

- Mathematical Concept: What operation(s) or concept is being tested?
- Problem Structure: Single-step or multi-step? What's the solution path?
- Numerical Complexity: Size of numbers, decimals, fractions, etc.
- Context/Scenario: What real-world situation is used?
- Given Information: What data is provided?
- Unknown/Question: What needs to be found?
- Units: What measurements are involved?

2. Variation Strategies

Context Substitution:
- Change the scenario while keeping the mathematical structure identical
- Replace characters with different names (maintain diversity)
- Use equivalent contexts: shopping → dining, travel → sports, cooking → crafting
- Keep the situation relatable and realistic for the target audience

Numerical Variation:
- Modify numbers while maintaining the same mathematical relationships
- Keep computational difficulty consistent
- Scale proportionally (if base uses 12 and 8, copies might use 15 and 10)
- Maintain number types (whole numbers, decimals, fractions) unless varying difficulty

Object/Entity Replacement:
- Substitute items with equivalents from the same category
- Examples: apples → oranges, cars → bikes, dollars → euros
- Ensure the replacement makes sense in the new context
- Keep units and measurements appropriate

Time/Location Changes:
- Modify temporal or spatial elements
- Different days, times, seasons, locations
- Maintain logical consistency within the problem

3. Preserve Problem Structure

CRITICAL: Keep these elements consistent:

✓ Same sentence structure and phrasing as the base question
✓ Same word order and sentence flow
✓ Same grammatical structure and style
✓ Same number of steps to solve
✓ Same mathematical operations required
✓ Same level of complexity
✓ Same cognitive demand (Bloom's taxonomy level)
✓ Same problem type (find total, find difference, find rate, etc.)
✓ Similar word count and reading level
✓ CRITICAL: The base question has {num_options} options, so ALL copy questions MUST have EXACTLY {num_options} options (same as base question)

4. Quality Control Checks

Before finalizing each similar problem:

✓ Does it test the exact same mathematical concept?
✓ Does it match the base question's sentence structure and phrasing?
✓ Is the word order and grammatical structure the same as the base question?
✓ Is the difficulty level equivalent?
✓ Does it require the same solution approach?
✓ Are all necessary details included?
✓ Is there no extraneous information (unless in base question)?
✓ Is the context realistic and engaging?
✓ Are numbers and units appropriate?
✓ Is the question clearly stated?
✓ Does it have EXACTLY {num_options} options (same as base question)?

CRITICAL REMINDERS:
- The base question has {num_options} options → ALL copy questions MUST have EXACTLY {num_options} options (same as base question)
- These word problem instructions are in addition to all other instructions. Follow them carefully when generating copy questions.

"""

- {question_type}: CHANGE ONLY the context/real-life scenario, keep the SAME math operation, structure, and question format. Preserve the same wording style and structure.
- CRITICAL: Each copy question MUST match the base question's sentence structure, phrasing, word order, and grammatical style
- CRITICAL: Each copy question MUST match the base question's format, structure, and style
- CRITICAL: Number of options MUST match the base question: Each question MUST have EXACTLY {num_options} options (same as the base question). DO NOT generate more or fewer options.
- CRITICAL: The base question has {num_options} options, so ALL copy questions MUST also have EXACTLY {num_options} options to match the base question format
- ONE option per question must be marked "CA" (Correct Answer)
- ALL copy questions must have the SAME number of options ({num_options} options) as the base question
- CRITICAL: Incorrect options MUST be based on ACTUAL ERRORS students would make when solving the BASE QUESTION or similar problems
- For each incorrect option, the logic must describe:
  1. What mistake a student would make when solving THIS type of question
  2. Common errors specific to the base question's concept/operation
  3. Realistic misconceptions students have about this problem type
- Logic must be SHORT (3-6 words) and SPECIFIC to the question type
- Examples: "CA", "Added instead of multiplied", "Forgot to carry over", "Wrong order of operations", "Place value mistake", "Used subtraction instead"
- {"IMPORTANT: Generate a solution for each question based on the base solution. Adapt the steps to match each question's numbers/context while keeping the same solution approach." if solution else ""}{image_instruction}

CRITICAL: COPY QUESTION FORMAT REQUIREMENT
Each copy question MUST:
1. Match the base question's sentence structure and phrasing EXACTLY
2. Use the same word order and grammatical structure as the base question
3. Match the base question's structure and format EXACTLY
4. Use the same wording style and phrasing as the base question
5. Keep the same question type (fill-in-the-blank, multiple choice, etc.)
6. Have EXACTLY {num_options} options (same as the base question) - this is CRITICAL
7. Only change the numbers (for mathematical) or context (for word problems)
8. Preserve the same punctuation, capitalization, and presentation style
9. Follow the same format as shown in the base question above

Example for Word Problems: If base question is "Sarah bought 3 apples for $2 each. How much did she spend in total?" with {num_options} options
Then copy questions should be: "Tom bought 5 oranges for $3 each. How much did he spend in total?" with EXACTLY {num_options} options
Notice: Same sentence structure, same phrasing pattern, same question format, SAME NUMBER OF OPTIONS ({num_options}) - only context (names, items, numbers) changed while preserving the exact structure.

IMPORTANT: Each distractor logic should reflect a REALISTIC mistake a student would make while solving problems similar to the base question. Base the logic on actual student errors, not generic mistakes.

CRITICAL JSON FORMAT REQUIREMENTS
- Your FIRST character MUST be [ (opening square bracket)
- Your LAST character MUST be ] (closing square bracket)
- Return ONLY a valid JSON array starting with [ and ending with ]
- DO NOT start with {{ (curly brace) - that means a single object, which is WRONG
- DO NOT return a single object - you MUST return an array
- NO markdown code blocks (no ```json or ```)
- NO explanations or text before or after the JSON
- NO comments or notes
- NO text before the opening bracket [
- NO text after the closing bracket ]
- Start response immediately with [
- End response with ]
- Ensure all strings are properly quoted with double quotes
- Ensure all brackets and braces are properly matched
- Do NOT include any text outside the JSON array

VERIFY BEFORE RESPONDING: Your response starts with [ and ends with ], not {{ and }}

⚠️⚠️⚠️ CRITICAL: You MUST return EXACTLY {num_questions} question objects in a JSON array. DO NOT return only one question.

Your response must be ONLY a JSON array containing EXACTLY {num_questions} question objects. Each object must have "question", "options", "image", and "solution" fields.

🔥🔥🔥 CRITICAL: YOUR RESPONSE MUST START WITH [ AND END WITH ] 🔥🔥🔥

DO NOT START WITH {{ (curly brace)
DO NOT RETURN A SINGLE OBJECT LIKE {{"question": ...}}
YOU MUST RETURN AN ARRAY: [{{...}}, {{...}}, ...]

Your response should look like this (example for 5 questions):
[{{"question": "...", "options": [...], "image": "", "solution": "..."}}, {{"question": "...", "options": [...], "image": "", "solution": "..."}}, {{"question": "...", "options": [...], "image": "", "solution": "..."}}, {{"question": "...", "options": [...], "image": "", "solution": "..."}}, {{"question": "...", "options": [...], "image": "", "solution": "..."}}]

WRONG FORMAT (DO NOT DO THIS):
{{"question": "...", "options": [...], "image": "", "solution": "..."}}

CORRECT FORMAT (DO THIS):
[{{"question": "...", "options": [...], "image": "", "solution": "..."}}, {{"question": "...", "options": [...], "image": "", "solution": "..."}}]

You MUST return an array with {num_questions} objects, starting with [ and ending with ].

⚠️ IMPORTANT: If {num_questions} > 1, you MUST generate {num_questions} DIFFERENT questions, each with different numbers or contexts. DO NOT duplicate the same question.

IMPORTANT: Study the base question format above and replicate it EXACTLY in your copy questions.

Example for Word Problems (if base question was "Sarah bought 3 apples for $2 each. How much did she spend in total?"):
[{{"question": "Tom bought 5 oranges for $3 each.

CRITICAL REMINDERS:
1. Base question has {num_options} options → ALL copy questions MUST have EXACTLY {num_options} options
2. SME NOTES (if provided) contain SPECIFIC instructions that MUST be followed in addition to all other prompt instructions
3. Follow SME NOTES exactly as they provide targeted guidance for generating the copy questions

⚠️⚠️⚠️ FINAL REMINDER: Return EXACTLY {num_questions} questions in an array. Start with [ and end with ]. No other text.

🔥 CRITICAL: Check that your response starts with [ (not {{) and ends with ] (not }}) 🔥
🔥 If you see {{ at the start, you're returning a single object - that's WRONG! 🔥
🔥 You MUST return an array: [{{...}}, {{...}}, ...] 🔥

{separator}
FINAL CHECKLIST BEFORE RESPONDING - COUNT YOUR QUESTIONS:
{separator}
1. Count how many question objects you are returning: it should be EXACTLY {num_questions}
2. Verify: Your JSON array should contain {num_questions} objects (count the opening braces)
3. Each question must be different (different numbers, different context, or different phrasing)
4. Each question MUST match the base question's format and structure exactly
5. Each question MUST use the same wording style as the base question
6. Your JSON array should start with [ and end with ]
7. NO other text before [ or after ]

CRITICAL VERIFICATION:
- If {num_questions} = 5, your array should look like: [{{...}}, {{...}}, {{...}}, {{...}}, {{...}}]
- If {num_questions} = 3, your array should look like: [{{...}}, {{...}}, {{...}}]
- If you return only 1 object when {num_questions} = {num_questions}, THE REQUEST WILL FAIL
- Each copy question must match the base question's format: same structure, same wording style, same type

DOUBLE-CHECK: 
1. Count the question objects in your response. You need {num_questions} objects.
2. Verify each question matches the base question's format and structure
3. Ensure each question uses the same wording style as the base question
4. Verify each question has EXACTLY {num_options} options (same as base question)
5. Ensure you followed ALL SME NOTES instructions (if provided)
